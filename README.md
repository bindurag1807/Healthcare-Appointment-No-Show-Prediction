#  üè• Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction

This project predicts whether patients will show up for their hospital appointments, helping healthcare providers reduce no-shows, optimize scheduling, and improve resource utilization through data-driven insights.

---

##  Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict appointment no-shows using historical data, and build a Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights such as reminder effectiveness and model performance.
- **Approach:** Data cleaning ‚Üí Decision Tree model training in Python ‚Üí Evaluation (Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall) ‚Üí Visualization in Power BI.

##  Dashboard Features

The included Power BI dashboard showcases:
-  Overall attendance vs. no-show rates  
-  High-risk patient analysis  
-  Impact of SMS reminders on no-shows  
-  Model performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy) visualized clearly

##  Results Summary

| Metric           | Value         |
|------------------|---------------|
| Model Accuracy   | 77.44%        |
| F1 Score         | 0.87          |
| Reminder Impact  | Slight reduction in no-show rate when SMS reminders were sent |
