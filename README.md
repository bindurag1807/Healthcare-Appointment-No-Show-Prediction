# 🏥 Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction

This project predicts whether a patient will **attend or miss their medical appointment**.  
It helps healthcare providers **optimize scheduling, reduce no-shows, and improve efficiency**.  
The project includes a **Machine Learning model (Decision Tree)** and a **Power BI Dashboard** for insights.  

---

## 📌 Objective
- Predict no-shows based on patient and appointment data.  
- Analyze the effect of **SMS reminders, show vs no show, appointments, and patient history** on attendance.  
- Provide actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python** → Data cleaning, model training (`Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Model building and evaluation  
- **Power BI** → Dashboard creation and visualization
